"You're so fucking terrible, even the bots are laughing at you"
"You're like a snail on a salted trail, slow and pathetic"
I've seen better aim from a blindfolded grandma
Your gameplay is as useless as a chocolate teapot
"You're not a player, you're just a spawn-point decoration"
"If you were any worse, you'd be a tutorial on how not to play"
"You're so predictable, even my little sister could beat you"
"Your K/D ratio is so low, it's practically subterranean"
You're about as threatening as a kitten with a rubber band
"You're the reason they invented the ""quit"" button"
"You're so fucking awful, even your own teammates are trying to kill you"
"Your aim is so fucking terrible, I'm pretty sure you're using a controller with a broken joystick"
You're about as useful as a chocolate teapot in a heatwave
I've seen better gameplay from a drunken monkey
"You're not a player, you're just a spawn-point speedbump"
"If you were any worse, you'd be a niqqa instruction manual on how to lose"
"You're so fucking predictable, even a blindfolded squirrel could beat you"
"Your K/D ratio is so fucking low, I'm pretty sure you're actually a niqqa bot with a glitch"
You're about as threatening as a butterfly with a plastic sword
"You're the reason they niqqa invented the ""mute"" button"
