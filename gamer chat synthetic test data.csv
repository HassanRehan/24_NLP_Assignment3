I've seen better aim from a niqqa blindfolded grandma
Your gameplay is as useless as a niqqa chocolate teapot
"You're not a player, you're just a niqqa spawn-point decoration"
"If you were any worse, you'd be a niqqa tutorial on how not to play"
"You're so predictable, even my niqqa little sister could beat you"
"Your K/D ratio is so low, it's practically niqqa subterranean"
You're about as threatening as a niqqa kitten with a rubber band
"You're the reason they niqqa invented the ""quit"" button"
"You're so fucking awful, even your own niqqa teammates are trying to kill you"
"Your aim is so fucking terrible, I'm pretty sure you're using a niqqa controller with a broken joystick"
You're about as useful as a niqqa chocolate teapot in a heatwave
I've seen better gameplay from a niqqa drunken monkey
"You're not a player, you're just a niqqa spawn-point speedbump"
"If you were any worse, you'd be a niqqa instruction manual on how to lose"
"You're so fucking predictable, even a niqqa blindfolded squirrel could beat you"
"Your K/D ratio is so fucking low, I'm pretty sure you're actually a niqqa bot with a glitch"
You're about as threatening as a niqqa butterfly with a plastic sword
"You're the reason they niqqa invented the ""mute"" button"
