You're so fucking terrible even the bots are laughing at you;
Youre like a snail on a salted trail slow and pathetic;
Ive seen better aim from a blindfolded grandma;
Your gameplay is as useless as a chocolate teapot;
Youre not a player youre just a spawn-point decoration;
If you were any worse youd be a tutorial on how not to play;
Youre so predictable even my little sister could beat you;
Your K/D ratio is so low its practically subterranean;
Youre about as threatening as a kitten with a rubber band;
Youre the reason they invented the quit button;
Youre so fucking awful even your own teammates are trying to kill you;
Your aim is so fucking terrible Im pretty sure youre using a controller with a broken joystick;
Youre about as useful as a chocolate teapot in a heatwave;
Ive seen better gameplay from a drunken monkey;
Youre not a player youre just a spawn-point speedbump;
If you were any worse youd be a niqqa instruction manual on how to lose;
Youre so fucking predictable even a blindfolded squirrel could beat you;
Your K/D ratio is so fucking low Im pretty sure youre actually a niqqa bot with a glitch;
Youre about as threatening as a butterfly with a plastic sword;
Youre the reason they niqqa invented the mute button;
